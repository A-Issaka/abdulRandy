                There are many, many types of AI, but we will just be showing 5 of the most used types: Narrow, Generative, Descriptive, Diagnostic, Predictive.
                This is in no specific order, but the 3 of these CAN (not do) go together, so I will put them at the end.

                    Narrow AI is the most used AI, mainly used for reccomendation algorithms, virtual assistants, and image recognition.
                    Narrow AI has its name because its used to perform specific tasks and stays limited to that, so it can be used for anything, but only that one thing.
                    This type of AI is heavily data-driven, meaning it relies on data.
                    Its not really made to try and replicate human intelligence, emotions, or consciousness.
                    Due to its limits, it's also reffered to as "Inferior AI" or "Weak AI".
                    Looking at the examples, its clear that this type of AI is used a lot in our daily lives.
                    Its the most popular mainly because tons of businesses use this, meaning their customers kind of use it.

                    Generative AI refers to a class of artificial intelligence models that can generate new content, such as text, images, music, or videos, based on patterns learned from existing data.
                    Some of the most popular examples of generative AI include OpenAI's GPT for text generation, DALL·E for creating images, and Jukedeck for music composition.
                    With generative AI, users can create everything from written articles and artwork to original songs and realistic videos. 
                    While these AI systems can mimic certain aspects of human creativity, they are still fundamentally different from human intelligence, as they lack consciousness, emotions, or the ability to understand context in the same way humans do.
                    In fact, the paragraph you’re reading right now was generated by AI, demonstrating its ability to craft coherent and creative text.

                    I will use an example and play these into eachother, one after another.
                    The example I will be using is predicting and managing equipment maintenance in a factory.
                    So today, in the factory, we had an equipment failure, so we need to find out what exactly happened, so we would use
                    <h1 class="text-warning">DESCRIPTIVE AI</h1>
                    to analyze historical data about when the machines were serviced, how frequent the failures are, and what maintenance is performed to see how often this happens.
                    This plays directly into
                    <h1 class="text-warning">DIAGNOSTIC AI</h1>
                    which can be used to analyze the data, and finds patterns in the occurence.
                    This can be used to find reasons that lead to these failures, and helps find out why.
                    With this information,
                    <h1 class="text-warning">PREDICTIVE AI</h1>
                    can be used to predict what can happen in the future based of patterns, and in the factory, this could be used to try and minimize the damage those failures cause.
                    These all come together very well and it seems reasonable that the 3 of these are all top 5.
